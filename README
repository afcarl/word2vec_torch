Only has the skip-gram architecture with negative sampling. See https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ for more details.

Note: This is considerably slower than the word2vec toolkit and gensim implementations.

Input file is a text file where each line represents one sentence (see corpus.txt for an example)

Arguments are mostly self-explantory (see main.lua for default arguments)

-corpus 
-window
-dim
-alpha
-table_size
-neg_samples
-minfreq
-lr
-min_lr
-epochs

For example:

th main.lua -corpus corpus.txt -window 3 -dim 100 -minfreq 10
